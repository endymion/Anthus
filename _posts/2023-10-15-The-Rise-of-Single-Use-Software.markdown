Imagine a late-night call, an alarm from an order-processing system.  An order in trouble, and you're the one who needs to untangle the mess.  It's a familiar scenario for a DevOps practitioner, but the solution lies in something other than your existing toolset this time.  You require something different -- the ability to massage the data within the order before reprocessing it.  Your organization's toolbox contains tools for order reprocessing but not for this precise task.

No problem, though.  You take a leap of faith and paste code from your existing toolkit into ChatGPT.  In moments, it crafts a bespoke script tailored to the problem at hand.  You <mark>run it once</mark>, post the order, and it does its job flawlessly.  <mark>You'll never use that script again.</mark>  Instead of relying on pre-built tools, you've embraced a new era of just-in-time development with AI.

## Empowering individuals

Consider the difference between ChatGPT's "Advanced Data Analysis" and traditional tools like Excel for everyday data analysis tasks.  Imagine a scenario where you have a CSV file filled with sales data, and your goal is to compute aggregate revenue sums for various time periods.  With Excel, you might use your spreadsheet prowess to open the file and filter and aggregate the data.

Alternatively, you could paste the CSV into ChatGPT and ask it to compute the sums.  It will generate <mark>one-time Python code tailored to your specific task</mark>, achieving the same result.  There's no need to accept <mark>expenses related to retaining and reusing and marketing and sustaining the code</mark> because it has no value beyond that task.  You <mark>use it once and then you throw it away.</mark>

There's no definitive "better" option between Excel and ChatGPT for data analysis. Both have their strengths.  Excel remains a powerful and versatile tool for a wide range of tasks, but it required a big investment to create and a big investment on your part to learn to use it.  However, the emergence of AI-driven solutions provides individuals with alternative solutions that can bypass the need for a sophisticated tool that takes time to learn.  Individuals are more empowered to <mark>focus on their problems rather than on their tools</mark>, and to choose the most suitable solution for the task at hand.

## Driving organizational efficiency

### Cloud Computing: Just-in-time computer hardware expenses

Imagine running a business that relies on powerful computers to operate.  Before the cloud computing revolution, you had to buy these computers in advance and <mark>accept the total cost of ownership</mark>.  It's similar to purchasing a car – you pay a large sum upfront, even if you might not use it to its full capacity every day.  And the sticker price is never the full price of owning and maintaining the car for years.

In the technology world, this upfront investment in owning and maintaining computers is known as "Capital Expenditure" or CAPEX.  It's like buying the car outright, paying a lump sum initially.

Now, think about cloud computing.  It's like the concept of renting a car when you need it.  Instead of owning and maintaining computers, <mark>you only pay for the computing power you use when you need it.</mark>  It's similar to renting a car for a specific trip – you pay for it only during that time.

This model is called "Operating Expenditure" or OPEX in the technology world.  It's like renting a car when you need it and paying for what you use, rather than buying it upfront.  It's been said that <mark>"cloud computing" simply means "someone else's computer"</mark>, and that's really the whole point: <mark>You don't have to own the computer to use it.</mark>

### Single-use software applications: Just-in-time development expenses

The shift from CAPEX to OPEX in cloud computing revolutionized how companies operate and how entrepreneurs finance startups.  Now, think about the emerging trend of single-use software applications.  The same principle of <mark>driving efficiency by paying only for what you need also applies now to software development</mark>.

Traditionally, companies would invest heavily in building or buying large software applications, similar to purchasing those powerful computers upfront.  They had to anticipate all their future software needs and commit a lot of money upfront, like buying a fleet of cars.

But now, with the emergence of single-use software applications, organizations can create <mark>customized solutions on-demand</mark>, just like renting a car when they need one, rather than purchasing a company car.  They invest in software development only when they genuinely need a specific solution, reducing the financial risk and upfront commitments associated with traditional software development.

This shift empowers organizations to be more agile and responsive to their software needs, much like how cloud computing allows them to instantly provision computing resources when they need them instead of investing in equipment they might never fully utilize.  It's all about optimizing resources, reducing financial risks, and enabling innovation by creating software precisely when it's needed.  This <mark>parallels the fundamental value proposition of cloud computing</mark>: You can use a computer without owning it.

## Society revolutionized: Just-in-time hardware and software

From a broader societal standpoint, the emergence of single-use software applications represents a monumental shift in the tech landscape.  It's not merely a repetition of the shift from capital expenditures (CAPEX) to operational expenditures (OPEX), as seen in cloud computing; it's a leap to the next level by eliminating software barriers to entry in addition to the hardware barriers -- leaving no barriers.

Think about how cloud computing democratized access to computing power, allowing smaller players with limited financial resources to access computing capabilities that were once exclusive to major corporations with substantial budgets.  Now, <mark>the same democratization is happening in the software realm</mark>.  Smaller teams, startups, and individuals are gaining the ability to harness AI-driven tools to efficiently drive business value without first obtaining financing to pay for software development.

This profound change has far-reaching societal implications.  It accelerates technological progress by enabling a broader range of innovators to participate.  Smaller teams with limited financing can now tackle ambitious projects that were previously financially out of reach.  This will transforms society by significantly enhancing the agility of individuals and organizations.  Companies can adapt quickly to seize new opportunities that might have been too costly to pursue in the past.  It's a shift that <mark>empowers everyone to do more</mark>.

##  The future of apps:  Do we need them?

It's worth contemplating a question: Today, computing devices serve as containers for a collection of applications.  In the future, will we even need an operating system with a menu of applications?  <mark>What applications would be worth keeping when computers can solve problems directly, on-demand?</mark>  Why buy or license an app when you can ask the computer to solve the problem for you?  These questions invite us to envision a future where technology adapts to our needs, where software is as dynamic as our imagination, and where the possibilities are limited only by the questions we dare to ask.

## Conclusion

The emergence of single-use software applications marks a profound shift with remarkable implications for individuals and organizations.  The significance is undeniable as we move toward a future where AI dramatically reduces barriers to entry for software development.  Smaller teams, startups, and individuals now possess the capability to harness AI-driven tools and create sophisticated software solutions that were once the domain of well-funded organizations.

This transformation accelerates technological progress.  Remember the story of the late-night call and the just-in-time DevOps tool?  It exemplifies the power of these emerging trends, where a worker can immediately craft a bespoke solution to address a specific challenge.  This is <mark>the future of problem-solving – quick, tailored, and accessible.</mark>
