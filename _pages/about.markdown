## About us

Ryan Porter built an event ticket sales system for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope_World_Tour">TiÃ«sto world tour</a> in six weeks in 2009.  That system grew into a business that generated as much as <mark>$64 million per year</mark> for the next 14 years.  Anthus is Ryan and the DevOps team who did it, including a network of contractors.

We endured for so long because we operated a reliable system with <n>no significant business interruption and <mark>no major downtime, system impairment, or security incidents</mark>.  We achieved high availability over a decade during continuous development with multiple daily deployments.  We <mark>never took the system down for maintenance</mark>, even during deployments.  We <mark>never got hacked</mark> despite being a <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanAlynPorter/status/890982980721790976">prime target</a>.

We grew from a tiny startup team to being <mark>part of a large multinational corporation</mark>, with <mark>zero turnover in the core team</mark>.  We were subjected to dozens and dozens of <mark>audits from all of the top auditing firms</mark>, and close inspection from Madison Square Garden Entertainment when they became our parent company.  The auditors and MSGE all agreed that we know what we're doing and that we correctly managed the risks, or else we couldn't have endured for more than a decade.

Our system continuously evolved, adding a data warehouse, new third-party integrations, and integrations with Salesforce, Marketo, many other products, and other corporate workloads.  We steered our system through the <mark>cloud computing revolution, the serverless revolution, and into the AI revolution</mark>, adding an <mark>AI copilot</mark> toward the end.  We responsibly handed off operations to the next team on the way out, with <mark>no business interruption</mark>.

Now we can help you do something interesting.  And you can trust us to operate it until the money runs out.
