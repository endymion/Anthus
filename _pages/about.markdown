## About us

Ryan Porter built an event ticket sales system for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope_World_Tour">TiÃ«sto world tour</a> in six weeks in 2009.  That system grew into a business that generated as much as <b>$64 million per year</b> for the next 14 years.  Anthus is Ryan and the DevOps team who did it, including a network of contractors.

We endured for so long because we operated a reliable system with <n>no significant business interruption and <b>no major downtime, system impairment, or security incident</b>.  We achieved high availability over a decade during continuous development with multiple daily deployments.  We <b>never took the system down for maintenance</b>, even during deployments.  We <b>never got hacked</b> despite being a prime target.

Our system continuously evolved, adding a data warehouse, new third-party integrations, and integrations to other corporate workloads.  We grew from a tiny startup team to being <b>part of a large multinational corporation</b>, with nearly <b>zero turnover in the team</b>.  We steered our system through the <b>cloud computing revolution, the serverless revolution, and into the AI revolution</b>, adding an <b>AI copilot</b> toward the end.  We responsibly handed off operations to the next team on the way out, with <b>no business interruption</b>.

Now we can help you do something interesting.  And you can trust us to operate it until the money runs out.
