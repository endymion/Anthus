## About us

Ryan Porter built an event ticket sales system for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope_World_Tour">TiÃ«sto world tour</a> in six weeks in 2009.  That system grew into a business that generated as much as <mark>$64 million per year</mark> for the next 14 years.  Anthus is Ryan and the DevOps team who did it, including a network of contractors.

We endured for so long because we operated a reliable system with <n>no significant business interruption and <mark>no major downtime, system impairment, or security incidents</mark>.  We achieved high availability over a decade during continuous development with multiple daily deployments.  We <mark>never took the system down for maintenance</mark>, even during deployments.  We <mark>never got hacked</mark> despite being a <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanAlynPorter/status/890982980721790976">prime target</a>.

Our system continuously evolved, adding a data warehouse, new third-party integrations, and integrations to other corporate workloads.  We grew from a tiny startup team to being <mark>part of a large multinational corporation</mark>, with nearly <mark>zero turnover in the team</mark>.  We steered our system through the <mark>cloud computing revolution, the serverless revolution, and into the AI revolution</mark>, adding an <mark>AI copilot</mark> toward the end.  We responsibly handed off operations to the next team on the way out, with <mark>no business interruption</mark>.

Now we can help you do something interesting.  And you can trust us to operate it until the money runs out.
